# angular-google-map
The project illustrates weather condition in different cities on five days in row on google map. balloons are filtered by weather condition. also they can be filtered by day and city name.

This project has used angular material as UI framework

If you want to forward the project to someone else, you can delete the folder > “assets/lib” and the next person needs to follow these instructions:

1- Open CMD (in Mac open Terminal) and find the path of the project (or right click on the folder and use git bash) 

2- Write "bower install" then press "Enter"

3- Open index.html (to prevent from Cross Origin error open with Firefox or use chrome proper extension)

*	As the app was single page I did not use Ui-router (or ng-router) which can be added.
