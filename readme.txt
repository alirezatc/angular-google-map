If you want to forward the project to someone else, you can delete the folder > “assets/lib” and the next person needs to follow these instructions:
1- Open CMD (in Mac open Terminal) and find the path of the project (or right click on the folder and use git bash) 
2- Write "bower install" then press "Enter"
3- Open index.html (to prevent from Cross Origin error open with Firefox or use chrome proper extension)

Bellow the list of improvements that can be performed on the project:
1-	As the app was single page I did not use Ui-router (or ng-router) which can be added.
2-	Gmap windows can be designed or be controlled by angular material modals.
3-	Progress bar can be added.
4-	Bundling the js by gulp.
